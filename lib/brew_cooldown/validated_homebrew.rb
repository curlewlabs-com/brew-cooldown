  # The installer adapter prepends guards to Homebrew internals that carry no

  # time. Move this only together with the VM evidence for the new commit: the
  # Qualify workflow's run on the pull request that moves it (CONTRIBUTING.md).
  # The file loads without Homebrew so tooling can read the same value the
  # executor enforces.
